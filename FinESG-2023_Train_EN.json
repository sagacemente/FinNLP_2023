The recent annual 2022 CEO and Senior Business Executive Survey shows that, for the first time in the history of this survey, environmental sustainability has jumped into the top ten business priorities that CEOs must contend with, only slightly behind digital transformation and cybersecurity. This is driven by the increased demand by investors and other stakeholders (like consumers) who want businesses to act more on sustainability initiatives. Consumers are using ESG factors to make their buying decisions. As a result, CEOs are now viewing ESG strategies and reporting as a way to differentiate their companies from that of their peers, and more specifically as opportunities to drive business efficiencies, revenue growth and attract investors and customers. Incorporating digital transformation efforts into the ESG reporting process is one way CEOs can supercharge stakeholder firm value. For instance, CEOs can invest in dashboards to monitor, in real-time, trending or emerging ESG topics amongst peer companies or within the industry. This can help companies identify their own ESG shortcomings and strengths relative to their peers, allowing them to increase their agility on closing the gaps in their ESG initiatives and reporting. More importantly, companies can better position themselves to investors and customers. The pressure is on for CEOs to step up and meet the challenge.
